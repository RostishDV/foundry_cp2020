/**
 * Function written specifically to fix `attackSkill` being "undefined" in a compendium. Uses `attackSkills` from `lookups.js` to ensure there's only one option for skills and then update to that. If there are multiple choices (such as a weapon with Melee weaponType), this function skips that item and provides a warning. If needed, interactivity and more flexibility (ie not just for attackSkill) might be added at a later stage to allow choosing-as-you-go, but that's if you KNOW what the given item needs.
 * This likely doesn't need to stay around for long, but it's here just in case
 * Note: Back up your compendium before using this! Then turn edit lock to false on the compendium.
 * @param {*} packID ID of the compendium to fix these in. 
 * @returns An array of changed documents.
